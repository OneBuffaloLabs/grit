## ‚ú® Core Features (MVP)

- **Complete 75 Hard Tracking:** A simple, satisfying daily checklist for the 5 core tasks.
- **Privacy by Design:** All your data is stored exclusively on your device in the browser. No sign-up required, no data harvesting, ever.
- **Offline First:** The app works perfectly without an internet connection once loaded.
- **Progress Visualization:** A 75-day "Grit Grid" gives you a powerful, at-a-glance view of your commitment.
- **Private Photo Gallery:** Track your physical progress with daily photos that stay on your device.
- **The "Start Over" Rule:** The core mechanic of the challenge is built-in, reinforcing the mental toughness aspect of the program.

## üíª Tech Stack

Grit is built on a modern, client-only architecture.

- **Frontend Framework:** (e.g., React, Vue, or Svelte)
- **Database:** [PouchDB](https://pouchdb.com/) for all client-side storage, using the browser's best available engine (typically IndexedDB).
- **Styling:** (e.g., Tailwind CSS)
- **Deployment:** Hosted as a static site on a platform like Vercel, Netlify, or GitHub Pages.

## üß† Philosophy: Why Grit?

In a world of data breaches and intrusive apps, Grit takes a different approach. We believe that your self-improvement journey is personal.

1.  **Your Data is Yours:** We will never have access to your progress, your journal entries, or your photos.
2.  **No Distractions:** Grit does one thing and does it perfectly. There are no social feeds, no ads, and no unnecessary features to pull you off track.
3.  **Built on Open Standards:** Using PouchDB and a static site architecture makes the app fast, reliable, and secure.
